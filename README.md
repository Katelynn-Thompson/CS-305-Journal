Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting firm that specializes in creating personalized financial plans for their clients. As part of their efforts to expand their reach, they commissioned us to develop a public web application that could handle their customers' sensitive personal and financial data while ensuring the highest levels of security.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Throughout the class, I was able to refine my skills in identifying vulnerabilities, determining whether they can be suppressed, and researching possible fixes. It is crucial to prioritize secure coding practices, as vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access and system failures. By implementing secure coding practices, organizations can prevent data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage while adding value to their overall health. This approach safeguards sensitive data, builds customer trust, and prevents costly security incidents.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
During the vulnerability assessment, I faced some difficulties in analyzing and identifying various security issues in my code. However, I consider this as a learning opportunity to move forward and acknowledge that there is still a lot to learn!

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by adding encryption in my code using AES and checksum certificates and identifying and tackling vulnerabilities found in my code via Maven Dependency checks.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that my code and the application worked and were secure, I regularly ran and tested my code and performed numerous dependency checks to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the refactoring process.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Some valuable resources for me were learning to fully use Maven, watching many YouTube videos, and asking for help from the community via Discord or StackOverflow to find guidance. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Honestly, I would hope that future employers wouldn't see this assignment, and if they did, it could be used as a sign of growth or how far I had come. However, this isn't to say I'm not grateful for learning more about best secure practices in coding, just that more practice and time are needed until I feel confident enough to show it off!
